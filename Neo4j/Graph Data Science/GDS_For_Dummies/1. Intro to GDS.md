## What is Graph Data Science?
Graph data science is a science-driven approach to gain knowledge from the relationships and structures in data, typically to power predictions. It uses multi-disciplinary workflows that may include queries, statistics, algorithms, and ML. Graph data science can typically be broken down into three areas: 

### 1. Graph statistics
Provide basic measures about a graph, such as the number of nodes and distribution of relationships. These insights may influence how you configure and execute more complex analysis as well as interpret results. 

### 2. Graph analytics
Build on graph statistics by answering specific questions and gaining insights from connections in existing or historical data. Graph queries and algorithms are typically applied together in “recipes” during graph analytics, and the results are used directly for analysis.

### 3. Graph-enhanced ML and AI
Is the application of graph data and analytics results to train ML models or support probabilistic decisions within an AI system.
