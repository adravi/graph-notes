# Refining the model I

#### Eliminating duplicate data

**Purpose:**
- Creating nodes from properties where property values are duplicated in the graph
- Eliminating complex data in nodes that is expensive to query

**Avoiding duplicate data help us:**
- Improve query performance
- Reduce the amount of storage required for the graph

#### Adding NODE to remove properties

*Example*: Create LANGUAGE node and relationship IN_LANGUAGE instead of having the property ‘language’ repeated on every node
- **Pro Tip**: Cypher clause do you use to separate list elements: **UNWIND**

```
MATCH (m:Movie)
UNWIND m.languages AS language
WITH  language, collect(m) AS movies
MERGE (l:Language {name:language})
WITH l, movies
UNWIND movies AS m
WITH l,m
MERGE (m)-[:IN_LANGUAGE]->(l);
MATCH (m:Movie)
SET m.languages = null
```

Now, instead of retrieving ALL the movies and filtering by the property ‘languages’ (which was an array) we can simply perform the query:

```
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:IN_LANGUAGE]-(l:Language)
WHERE  l.name = 'Italian'
RETURN m.title
```
