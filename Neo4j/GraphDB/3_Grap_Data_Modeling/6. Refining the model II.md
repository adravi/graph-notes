# Refining the model II

### Eliminating complex data in nodes
(Nodes containing lots of properties for forming an ‘Address’ for example)
Eliminate duplication by turning generic relationships into specific ones

#### Using specific relationships
Purpose:
- Why specialized relationships can be beneficial.
- Dynamically creating relationships to specialize relationships in the graph.

#### APOC
- Ne4j as a graph database is implemented to traverse relationships quickly. In some cases it is more performant to query based on the relationships in the graph rather than properties on the nodes
- The queries sometimes benefit from having specialized relationships between the nodes. 
- These specialized relationships are worth it, only if the use cases that leverage them are highly important
- Special library: **APOC**
	- For dynamically merge relationships in the graph

*Example Of using APOC*
```
MATCH (n:User)-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)
CALL apoc.merge.relationship(n,
  ‘RATED_’ + r.rating,
  {},
  {},
  m ,
  {}
) YIELD rel
RETURN count(*) AS `Number of relationships merged`;
```

*Example. For rewritten query*
```
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN_1995|DIRECTED_1995]->()
RETURN p.name as `Actor or Director`
```

### Intermediate nodes

You created intermediate nodes when you need to (these 3 scenarios are used to make the graph relationships more “shareable” and meaningful between nodes):

- Connect more than 2 nodes in a single context. This is impossible in Neo4j because Neo4j only allow a relationship to be connected between 2 nodes
- Mathematics concept: **Hyperedges** (n-ary relationships)
- Relate something to a relationship
- Share data in the graph between entities

*Example: Create “Employment“ nodes*
