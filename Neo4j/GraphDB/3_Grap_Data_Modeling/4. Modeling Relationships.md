# Modeling Relationships

- [Neo4j Graph Academy](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/modeling-fundamentals/1-getting-started/1-what-is-modeling)

**Connections are the verbs in your use-cases.**
- *What ingredients are **used** in a recipe?*
- Relationship `TYPES` are important. They should have names that are intuitive to stakeholders and developers alike. They should **NOT** be confused with entity names
- Relationships direction **MUST** be specified
	- The are symmetric relationships in which case, the direction can be specified un either orientation

### Refactoring the Graph

##### Reasons to refactor
- The graph model does not answer all the use-cases
- A new use-case has come up that you need to account for in your data model
- The Cypher for the cases does not perform optimally, especially when the graph scales

##### Refactoring steps
1. Design the new data model
2. Write Cypher code to transform the existing graph to implement the new data model
3. Retest all use-cases, possibly with updated Cypher code

##### Labels at runtime
- Node labels anchor a query
- A subset of nodes are retrieved
- Do NOT overuse labels:
	- Only use them if they will help most of your use-cases
	- **Best practice:** Limit the maximum number of labels per node to 4
	- If a property will suffice, it is best to NOT have the label

- However, adding labels that make sense can improve the queries, as fewer nodes would be retrieved at runtime

*Example:* Add a label ‘Actor’ to the nodes
```
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE exists ((p)-[:ACTED_IN]-())
SET p:Actor
```

##### Re-testing after a refactor
- Identify which use-cases are affected by the refactor
- Rewrite any queries that can take advantage of the refactor
- Test all queries affected by the refactor to ensure they return the same results as before the refactoring
- `PROFILE` (inspect the number of nodes retrieved in the “Plain”/visual explorer) queries to determine if refactoring is a benefit using the new, more specific model labels
- After the refactor, you must:
	- Retest all the use cases that are affected by the refactor
	- Rewrite all the Cypher code that is affected by the refactor
	- Ensure the results are the same, and consistency of the retrievals was not compromised

*Example*: Using a relationship to add a new label consistently (‘Director’ for DIRECTED)  
```
MATCH (p:Person)-[:DIRECTED]-(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = 'Hoffa'
RETURN  p.name AS Director
````

##### Be mindful in your data model
- Choose semantically orthogonal labels (Use labels that will create a useful SUBSET of nodes, so they retrieval is fast)
- Avoid class hierarchies in labels (do not try to represent hierarchy using multiple labels for the same node)
