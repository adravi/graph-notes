## Cypher
#### Reading Data
- Hops
- Notation [ *0..2 ] 
- You can write queries for
	- “Finding all the nodes that are 2 hops away from node X”
	- “Finding the shortest path between 2 nodes

#### Caution
Poorly written queries:
- *can traverse the whole graph*
- *can be slow*
- *may provide unexpected results*

Always:
- Try to use relationship `TYPES` and `DIRECTIONS` wherever possible and whenever makes sense
- Limit how many traversals to make where it makes sense. Think twice before using `*`

### Cypher Conventions
- `NodeLabels` (Pascal case)
- `RELATIONSHIP_TYPES` (upper case snake case)
- `nodeProperties` and `relationshipProperties` (camel case)

`CREATE`
- Obviously to create (writing) data. However it just creates, it doesn’t check if the data already exists
- Same syntax as `MATCH` (everything is a pattern )
- No checks are made for data
- `MERGE` (keyword) works similarly to `UPSERT`
- You will need to specify a relationship type and a direction, and you should specify node labels

`SET`
- Update and existing property
- Add a new property 
- Add a new label (you can have more than one)
- Update relationship TYPES with SET is NOT POSSIBLE
- For SET first MATH the right pattern and retrieve the node of interest and the use the classical syntax to add new labels, etc
- REMOVE follows the same syntax as SET  

`DELETE`
- Removes nodes and relationships
- `MATCH` what you want to remove (remember! patterns!)
- `DETACH DELETE` for nodes
	- `MATCH`
	- `DETACH DELETE`

Updating Relationship `TYPES`
- There is no easy way to update relationship `TYPES`
- You will need to DELETE them and recreate the relationships
- Flow:
	- `MATCH` the two nodes
	- `CREATE` the new relationship
	- `DELETE` the existing relationship you no longer want

- Be careful, this could be slow. Consider using the Neo4j plugin **APAC** (which manages this better)
- Example:
	```
	MATCH (u1:Learner {name: ‘Joe’})-[r:KNOWS]->(u2:Learner {name: ‘Bob’})
	CREATE (u1)-[:FRIEND]->(u2)
	DELETE r
	```
  
Tips for writing complex queries:
- Double check the data model. What is connected to what?
- Relationship directions
- Case sensitivity
	- Matching labels, relationship `TYPES` and `properties` are case sensitive
