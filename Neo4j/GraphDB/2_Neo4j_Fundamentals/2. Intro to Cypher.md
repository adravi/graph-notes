## Cypher
- Graph Query Language
- Declarative
- Everything is a **pattern**
	- A lone node is a **pattern**
	- A pair of nodes in a relationship is a **pattern**
	- A path is a **pattern**

#### Syntax for **NODE**
|`( )`|**Node**|
|--|----|
| `(referenceA:LABEL)` | Labeled node |
| `(referenceA:LABEL {propertyKey:value} )` | Labeled node with property|

#### Syntax for **RELATIONSHIP**
| `--` | Relationship|
| --  | ------------|
| `-->` | A relationship with direction |
| `-[]->` | Also a relationship with direction |
| `-[refB]->` | A reference for that relationship |
| `-[refB: TYPE]->` | A type for relationship refB |
| `-[refB: TYPE {propertyKey: value}]->` | Typed relationship with property |


Always think in **PATTERNS!**
- A node
- A relationship between a node and another node
- Many relationships between many nodes
  
#### Counting and Aggregating data
- `Count()`
	- This counts the nodes or relationships in a given situation
- `Size()`
	- This gives us the size of an ARRAY (usually used after a collect)
- `Collect()`
- `LIMIT`
- `ORDER BY (ASC/DESC)` 
- `WITH`
	- Conceptually the same as RETURN
	- Keep variables in to use in further query
	- Mutate data as required - for example, using our counting and aggregating terms as well as using WHERE
