## Terminology
- **Nodes** : Vertices/discrete data entities
- **Relationships** : Connection/edges
- **Labels** : Node categories
- **Types**: Relationships categories
- **Properties**: Key-pair values applicable for both nodes and relationships. Used to further describe the graph

**A relationship always must have a direction when it is defined** but the direction doesn’t have to necessarily be used when we are querying our data.
