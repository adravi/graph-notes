#### Merge Processing
- Conditional property-updates depending if the node is newly created or just modified an existing one (that was matched by the pattern)

```
MERGE (m:Movie {title:’Freaky’})`
ON CREATE
SET m.released = 2020
ON MATCH
SET m.revenue = 15920855
RETURN m
```

- When creating a relationship, there could be problems if you try to do too much in a single `MERGE` statement
- A best practice is **TO SEPARATE** the **creation of the nodes** from the **creation of the relationships**

#### Deleting data
- **Deleting a node**
	- Just get a reference to the node and use the `DELETE` clause with that ref, but that’s if the node has only one relationship
	- BUT IF THE NODE HAS RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER NODE(S) **THIS IS A PROBLEM**
	- You cannot delete a node that still is connected to other nodes via some other relationship. It would make the graph inconsistent
	- INSTEAD we use `DETACH DELETE`
		- This first deletes all the relationships concerning the node, and then deletes the node

You want to delete **ALL the data in the graph**. Try:
```
MATCH (n)
ETACH DELETE n
```
