#### Creating Nodes
- The best practice is to use `MERGE`
	- `MERGE ( p:Person {name:’Tom Hanks’} )`
	
- The clause `MERGE` first checks if a node/relationship exists and then creates it (_Upsert_)
- When **merging a node** you must specify the **label** for the node and the **name and value** of the properties that uniquely identify the node.

#### Creating Relationships
- Remember to always use column
- `(:Label) for nodes`
- `[:TYPE] for relationships`

- The clause to create a relationship is again `MERGE`
- By default, a new relationship being created adds direction from left ro right
- However, it is a best practice to always indicate the direction of a relationship **EXPLICITLY**

```
MATCH (p:Person {name:'Daniel Kaluuya'}) 
MERGE (m:Movie {title:'Get Out'})
MERGE (p)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
```

You don’t have to add the `RETURN` statement unless you want to check your creation.

Executing multiple `MERGE` statements is safe because the entities are checked to exist first before they are created

#### Updating Properties

```
SET
```

```
MATCH (p:Person {name:’Tom Hanks’})
SET p.born = 1954
```

```
MERGE (p:Person {name:’Michael Caine’})
SET p.roles = [‘alfred’, ‘engenieur’]
```

##### Removing
```
MATCH …
WHERE
REMOVE node_reference.propertyName 
```
- Removing is equivalent to set the property to **null**
